# KNN-and-Naive-Bayes-assessment-IITD-FSM
 
Naive Bayes is a basic but effective probabilistic classification model in machine learning that draws influence from Bayes Theorem.
Bayes theorem is a formula that offers a conditional probability of an event A taking happening given another event B has previously happened.
Steps to perform Naive Bayes algorithm in python: 
-->Loading Initial Libraries
-->Importing Dataset
-->Exploring Dataset
-->Visualizing Dataset
-->Preprocessing
-->Data Normalization
-->Test Train Split
-->Accuracy

The k-nearest neighbors algorithm, is a non-parametric, supervised learning classifier, which uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point.
-->Importing the libraries and functions that will be used
-->In KNN algorithm, we will need a function to calculate the distances between training data points and the data that we would like to classify.
-->Try to find the neighbors, the closest data points to the data that we want to classify. 
-->After finding the k-nearest neighbors, we try to predict the classes that our test data points belong to
-->In predict function, it is quite easy to predict the label for data points if weights are uniform. 
-->Implemented the score function as a very simple accuracy metric
